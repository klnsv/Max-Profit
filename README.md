# Max-Profit
This repository contains some trading algos/strategies, which used 'MSFT' historical data and uses Machine Learning to predict certain parameters and I have devised some strategies through various researches, which led me to finalise three best and low-risk strategies, which helped me gain some profits on paper as I didn't have enough capital to buy broker's API and execute trades and become profitable (:  

This project helped me learn a lot of stuff, which was new to me before the project although I was well versed in the topics of finance, this project helped me explore the integration of computers and the world of finance and the world of quantitative finance

### Points to Note:
I have used `MSFT`, which is the stock issued by the company Microsoft in the exchange called NYSE (New York Securities Exchange). I have used a month's worth of data of the MSFT stock to train the model and predict some fancy stuff.

I highly recommend using these strategies in the world of crypto since,
  1. Crypto market is up almost 99.99% percent of the time, unlike stocks
  2. Crypto market is highly volatile, unlike stocks, especially index stocks like `MSFT`
  3. There is no holidays on weekends and special occasions in crypto.
  4. Higher percentage of computer algorithms or quantitative models to execute trades in the crypto world
  5. Lower fees since we will execute large number of trades in each strategy

### Machine Learning Model Statistics:
1. R2 Score: 0.9999 (1.00 is the score for the best model)
2. Mean Squared Error: 0.64 (0.64 Mean squared error with the mean of predicted values of 400, which is impressive)  

### Strategy Statistics:

**Time Period: `1 Month`**  
**No of Trades per strategy: `546`**  

1. PnL percentage on Strategy 1: 6.21%
2. PnL percentage on Strategy 2: 170%
3. PnL percentage on Strategy 3: 390%
